# Simulation of Galaxy Merging with Binary Blackholes
Princeton project 
## Introduction - Overview
In the Universe, almost every large galaxy has at its center a giant black hole, called a supermassive black hole. Scientists believe that these black holes and their host galaxies have grown together over time. This idea is known as coevolution. It comes from the observation that the size of a black hole seems to be related to the size of its galaxy. The two appear to share a common history, evolving side by side since the early stages of the Universe. 
Astrophysicians of Princeton university, created a simulation of a merging of two galaxies each of them containing a supremassive blackhole, the purpose is to study the coevolution between galaxies and supremassive blackholes.  

## What did I do ? 
The simulation created allowed me to obtain two database files containing numerical data illustrating the behavior of the two black holes in the galaxies that were merging. I was able to access these data using Python with the ‘pandas’ library, and I analyzed them with ‘matplotlib’, which enabled me to plot graphs in order to understand how these numerical values were related to each other and what connections could be made between them.

## Graphs
In order to understand what happens we chose to analyse these two datasets through graphical analysis that provides valuable insight into the coevolution of black holes and their host galaxies.
